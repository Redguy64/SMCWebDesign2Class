                <h1>About CCF</h1>
                <p>As we look to the future, the California Community Foundation’s Board of Directors and staff remain
                    fully committed to making a difference through meaningful advocacy, outreach and community
                    investments. Ultimately, we understand that every dollar we grant represents a donor’s legacy, a
                    dream for lasting change and a chance to bring that dream to life.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to lead positive systemic change that strengthens Los Angeles communities. We envision
                    a future where all Angelenos have the opportunity to contribute to the productivity, health and
                    well-being of our region. And we believe that our common fate will be determined by how successfully
                    we improve the quality of life for all of our residents. The impact we help create is of, by and for
                    Los Angeles, because the community is our foundation.</p>

                <h2>A Billion-Dollar Pledge to L.A.</h2>
                <p>In 2015, the California Community Foundation celebrated 100 years of service by making a
                    billion-dollar pledge to the people of Los Angeles County.Discover the progress we and our donors
                    have made and how this pledge is already transforming L.A. communities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item-3">
                <h2>What we Fund</h2>
                <p>We are driven to find long-term, systemic solutions addressing the root causes of the most pressing
                    issues facing Los Angeles County. Since 2000, we have given more than $200 million in discretionary
                    grants, impacting hundreds of thousands of lives and helping to transform entire communities. Every
                    one of those grants represented the legacy of a donor who was dedicated to creating a healthier,
                    more prosperous and empowered L.A.</p>

                <h2>How We Work</h2>
                <p>Every year, we and our donors invest tens of millions in transforming Los Angeles, but real change
                    takes more than money. Through partnerships and innovative approaches, we use our tools to maximize
                    impact, empower communities and strengthen the nonprofit sector for generations to come.</p>
